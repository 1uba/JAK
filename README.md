# JAK - JAvascriptov√° Knihovna #


JAK is an open-sourced JavaScript toolkit, created by Seznam.cz, a.s. It aims to simplify development of recurring JS tasks. Several widgets are included. 

This version of JAK is **not** (yet) compatible with public released version at [http://jak.seznam.cz/](http://jak.seznam.cz/) (in Czech).

We use JSUnit for testing JAK core library. Test are in /test directory. Testing Request works only with PHP on server side.
